					<p class="center">ASSIGNMENT IV<br />
						A NEW HOPE FOR JAVASCRIPT</p>

					<p>It is a period for being swamped with homework.  A brave student has decided to use STAR WARS as his theme for the game of HANGMAN.</p>

					<p>Striking any key to begin playing, you are charged with identifying which character has been chosen.</p>

					<p>You have 15 guesses (LOWERCASE LETTERS ONLY) before you are fed to the Sarlacc where you will be digested over thousands of years.</p>
